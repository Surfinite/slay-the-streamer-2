# Follow-ups and Deferred Items

Living list of things flagged during sessions that need attention later. Updated as discovered; ticked off as resolved. Most recent items at the top of each section.

---

## Outstanding from session 2

### First action next session

- [ ] **Code-quality review for commit `bfb77d6`** (Task 5.2 — VoteSession parsing + tally). Implementer reported DONE, but spec/code-quality reviewer rounds were not run before the session's context budget ran out. Implementation is verbatim per plan, so risk is low; do the review as the first subagent dispatch in the new session.

### Polish (deferrable; only do if/when biting)

- [ ] **`*.sln` gitignore section placement** — currently under "OS" section in `.gitignore`. Reviewer suggested moving to a dedicated "Build artefacts" section. Cosmetic.
- [ ] **`FakeChatService` polish** (from Task 3.1 review):
  - Use `_sent.AsReadOnly()` instead of returning `_sent` cast as `IReadOnlyList<SentMessage>`; closes a determined-cast loophole.
  - Add three small tests: `SimulateState` event firing, `Dispose` transition to `Disposed`, same-state transition is silent.
- [ ] **`FakeTimerScheduler.SchedulePeriodic`** doesn't validate `interval > 0`. Plan A call sites are safe (cadence floor 7s). Defensive guard one-liner.
- [ ] **`ImmediateDispatcher.Post(null)`** would NRE inside the lambda. Optional `ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull(action)` for clearer stack.
- [ ] **`DrainAsyncCompletesImmediately` test** asserts no-throw, not actual immediate completion. A regression making it `Task.Delay(5s)` would still pass. Optional: assert `IsCompletedSuccessfully` before awaiting.

---

## Pre-Plan-B prep (before writing Plan B)

- [ ] **Switch Steam branch from beta to stable.** User is on beta during Plan A; agreed to switch before Plan B. Steam re-download takes time.
- [ ] **Re-run `ilspycmd`** against the new stable `sts2.dll`. Diff against `decompiled/sts2/` for API-surface changes.
- [ ] **Update `notes/03/04/05`** for any modding-API drift between beta and stable.
- [ ] **Verify `MegaCrit.Sts2.Core.Logging.Log` is thread-safe.** Plan B's IRC background task + timer threads call it before reaching the dispatcher. If not thread-safe, the default `TiLog.Sink` must buffer + flush on the main thread.
- [ ] **Validate Godot autoload registration from a mod assembly.** `AddAutoloadSingleton` needs a Node-class reference. Runtime registration via `ProjectSettings.SetSetting("autoload/...")` from `[ModInitializer]` may or may not work. Have a fallback for `DispatcherAutoload`.
- [ ] **Smoke-test the Harmony deadlock risk**: blocking `await Voter.Start(...).AwaitWinnerAsync()` from a Harmony prefix on the Godot main thread, where AwaitWinnerAsync continuations also dispatch to the main thread. Verify before relying on the pattern.

## Plan B implementation reminders

Items deferred from Plan A reviews to "fix when the real impl lands":

- [ ] **`TiLog.Sink` should scrub `ex.ToString()`** before forwarding. `TiLog.Error(msg, ex)` only scrubs `msg`; if an exception's Message contains an oauth token (e.g., wrapped HTTP exception), an unscrubbed Sink that calls `ex.ToString()` leaks it. Wire up in Plan B's `ModEntry` Sink.
- [ ] **Pin down `IMainThreadDispatcher.DrainAsync` re-entrancy contract.** Are actions enqueued *during* draining awaited? Or only those queued *at the moment of the call*? Document, match `GodotMainThreadDispatcher`'s actual behaviour, add a test.
- [ ] **Pin down `IMainThreadDispatcher.Post` exception policy.** Synchronous (`ImmediateDispatcher`) propagates. Godot impl can't propagate (`CallDeferred` is fire-and-forget). Choose: log via `TiLog.Error` + continue (recommended), swallow, or crash. Document on the interface; add a queue-poison-resistance test for `GodotMainThreadDispatcher`.
- [ ] **`TwitchIrcChatService` must stamp `ChatMessage.ReceivedAt`** when `tmi-sent-ts` tag is absent. Plan A's parser returns `DateTimeOffset.MinValue` as a sentinel; service stamps from injected `IClock` before raising `MessageReceived`.

## Optional Enhancements not folded in

From the meta-review's Optional Enhancements table — flagged for future consideration:

- [ ] **#2 Reply-parent-msg-id per-voter receipts.** Bot @-replies first-time voters via Twitch's reply-thread feature. Closes the lag gap individually. Strong v0.2 candidate; lean-no for v0.1 (volume scales with brigade size).
- [ ] **#5 Observability dashboard.** Basic counters are in v2.3; fuller per-stream stats dashboard is post-MVP.
- [ ] **#7 `TimeProvider` (BCL .NET 8+)** instead of custom `IClock`/`ITimerScheduler`. ~30 lines of custom code vs. one NuGet dep. Revisit if NuGet deps become acceptable.
- [ ] **#8 Vendor a single-file Twitch IRC library** as Plan B fallback if handcrafted client proves problematic.

(#3 quiet-period dedup is effectively resolved by v2.3's tally-state dedup. #4 heartbeat reconnect was deliberately removed in v2.2 spec rollback.)

---

## Spec-level open items (from v2.3 spec)

- [ ] **Streamer oauth source / onboarding UX** — covered when settings UI is designed.
- [ ] **Streamer-configurable receipt policy** — ship `VoteReceiptPolicy.Default` for v0.1; expose configuration with the settings UI.
- [ ] **Reconnect retry budget knob** (`MaxRetryDuration`) — add if transport-retry-forever proves annoying. Auth/join failures are already terminal.
- [ ] **`AbstractModel` vs Harmony per-decision** — orthogonal to TI layer. Decide per `Game/DecisionVotes/*` patch in Plan B+. See `notes/04-abstract-model-hook-surface.md` table for the per-decision recommendation.

---

## v0.2+ (explicitly out of scope for v0.1)

- **StS2 co-op multiplayer.** API is multiplayer-aware (`VoteCoordinator` is instance-based per Reviewer 6's catch); full multi-streamer impl deferred.
- **Subscriber/mod/VIP-only voting filters.** `ChatMessage` already exposes badge flags; future filter is a `where`-clause in `VoteCoordinator.Start` consumers.
- **Localised receipts.** Add peer static helpers (`SpanishReceipts.cs` etc.) + `Func<VoteSnapshot, ReceiptKind, string>` to `VoteCoordinator.Start`.
- **`ChatCommandRouter` middle tier.** Only when a second non-voting consumer mod actually appears.
- **Twitch Helix API.** Channel-point redemptions, polls, predictions — out of scope.
- **Twitch Extension overlays / whispers.** Read-only IRC + periodic receipts is the entire v0.1 surface.
- **Lifting `Ti/*` into a separate base-mod assembly** (TI-extraction goal). Plan A's seams are pre-drawn so this is a file-move + small registration shim, not a refactor.

---

## Reference materials worth peeking before Plan B

Optional but useful:

- **Crowd Control mod for StS2** (`C:\Users\Surfinite\Downloads\SlayTheSpire2-CC-110.zip`) — Warp World's `CrowdControl.dll` via ILSpy as a *capability reference* (proves which game systems are mod-reachable).
- **spire-scryer** (`github.com/Sezmol/spire-scryer`) — open-source C# StS2 mod that pushes `RunManager` state to Cloudflare Worker → Twitch PubSub overlay. Useful as a reading-game-state reference. No declared license.
- **spire-codex** (`github.com/ptrlrd/spire-codex`) — not a mod, a web data service. Useful as a card/relic/event data reference.
